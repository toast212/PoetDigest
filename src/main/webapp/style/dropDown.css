/* To implement dropDowns, we have three styling elements (that are referenced by the JS code): 
*
*    - dropDown: a div container for dropDown header and (sibling associated dropDown content
*    - dropHeader: visible upon first rendering. when you click on a drop header, 
*          its related content will open up.
*    - dropContent: initially hidden, but becomes visible when the dropHeader is clicked.

/* This is an example of how to create a style sheet that "goes with" some "framework style JavaScript code". 
   After selecting a name for our framework (in this case, I'm calling it "dropDown"), we name our style sheet.
   I'm naming it "dropDown.css". Inside the style sheet, I have only one single global CSS classname ".dropDown". 
   All style rules must begind with that single global CSS classname so that we do not claim global CSS classnames 
   that the HTML coder (a person using our little framework) might want to use. We are avoiding polluting the 
   global namespace.
